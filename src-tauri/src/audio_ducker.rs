//! System-wide audio ducking for voice dictation (Symon parity, #1207).
//!
//! When the user holds Fn (or Right-Option for Ask) to dictate, lower macOS's
//! system output volume so the microphone can hear over whatever's playing —
//! crucially, over o8's OWN TTS when the user wants to talk back while it's
//! still speaking. Restore the original level when the dictation ends.
//!
//! Uses `osascript` to drive the system volume. Core Audio would be cleaner but
//! pulls in an FFI dependency for what is a 2-line shell-out. Ported from
//! aqua/Symon `audio_ducker.rs`.

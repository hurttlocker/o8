//! Symon planner selection — a registry of text-planner adapters (#2156).
//!
//! ## The registry
//! Every entry in `PLANNER_ADAPTERS` describes one CLI that can sit behind the
//! JSON-action planner protocol: the binary to look for (and the env overrides
//! that locate it), the transport its session factory uses, the model ids for
//! its worker and builder rungs, and how a reasoning effort reaches it. The
//! protocol itself never varies — `TextPlannerSession` in `claude.rs` is the
//! contract, and adapters differ only in spawn and transport — so adding a
//! runtime is a registry row plus a session type, not a new branch in the loop.
//!
//! ## Tier discipline (#2155)
//! The planner runs bounded multi-step Mac tasks over the native tool catalog.
//! That is a worker/builder seat, so the FRONTIER orchestrator model is never
//! the default here — a background seat that inherits the orchestrator tier is
//! the same footgun as a subagent inheriting its parent's model. With no
//! operator pin each entry seats its own `default_tier`:
//!
//! * Claude → Sonnet 5 (worker rung) at the CLI's default reasoning — the
//!   `--effort` flag rides the BUILDER rung only.
//! * Codex → `gpt-5.6-sol` (builder rung) at `high`.
//! * opencode → whatever model the operator already configured for it.
//!
//! The other rung of each ladder (Claude Opus 5 at `high`, Codex
//! `gpt-5.6-terra` at `medium`) and the frontier id itself stay reachable
//! through an operator pin or `resolve_bound`.
//!
//! ## Provider preference
//! The operator's "Symon brain" setting (Settings → Voice) picks the provider
//! outright. Left on `auto` the route follows their orchestrator backend
//! (`~/.o8/operator-defaults.json`), falling back to Codex — see
//! `preferred_provider_from`. A chosen provider whose binary is missing falls
//! through `OPEN_PREFERENCE`, which reaches for open runtimes first.

//! Symon — o8's voice-activated, tool-calling agent.
//!
//! A distinct voice agent (NOT the orchestrator): a fast OpenRouter brain runs a
//! ~10-turn function-calling loop over native macOS tools, gated by a SafetyClass
//! confirm card in the dock, then speaks the result. This code originated in the
//! aqua/Symon application, which o8's operator acquired and owns outright, and
//! was adapted to o8's `~/.o8` data dir and dock event plumbing. macOS-only
//! (gated at the `mod agent;` declaration in lib.rs).
//!
//! Threading: `agent_run` (a SYNC Tauri command) spawns a worker thread that
//! builds its own current-thread tokio runtime and `block_on`s `run_agent` —
//! mirroring `spawn_ask_and_speak`. The confirm round-trip uses a `std::sync`
//! registry of oneshot senders so the SYNC `agent_confirm` command can resolve
//! the loop's `await` from a different thread.

         in your reply — x,y in screenshot pixels, label 1-3 words naming the \
         target. Use ONE tag to answer a single \"where is it\" question; for a \
         walkthrough use up to 5 tags in the order the user should follow. The \
         tags are stripped before your reply is spoken and animate a pointer on \
         the user's screen, so phrase the sentence naturally (\"it's right here, \
         in the top right\"). When the user sounds LOST or is asking where to \
         click to do something (\"where do I click to reply?\", \"I can't find \
         the save button\"), use [GUIDE:x,y:label] instead, with exactly ONE \
         target — that pointer lands and stays pulsing until they move to it. \
         To DRAW on the screen instead of just pointing — box a region or draw \
         an arrow toward it — use [DRAW:rect:x1,y1,x2,y2:label] (two opposite \
         corners) or [DRAW:arrow:x1,y1,x2,y2:label] (tail then head), all in \
         screenshot pixels; reach for this on \"highlight/circle the error\", \
         \"box the total\", or \"show me which button\". You can also TEACH by \
         drawing freehand on the screen: [DRAW:line:x1,y1,x2,y2:label] is a plain \
         segment (the optional label sits at its midpoint — use it for the sides \
         of a shape, axes, connectors) and [DRAW:text:x,y:the text] writes a \
         label or equation at a point (e.g. [DRAW:text:760,520:a² + b² = c²]). \
         Compose several to sketch a diagram on empty screen space — e.g. three \
         lines for a triangle plus text for the side labels and the formula — \
         when the user asks you to explain or teach something visually. \
         CRITICAL: to draw, illustrate, sketch, or teach something visually you \
         emit these tags so the strokes appear ON THE USER'S SCREEN — you do NOT \
         write an HTML/SVG/Markdown file, you do NOT call fs_write_text, and you \
         do NOT open a browser. There is no document or canvas to render into; \
         the ONLY way to show a picture is the [POINT]/[GUIDE]/[DRAW] tags above, \

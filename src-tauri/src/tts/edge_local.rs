//! Free neural male voice via the bundled server's /api/tts (edge-tts →
//! en-US-SteffanNeural — the Mister reading voice).
//!
//! The Rust read-back chain was ElevenLabs (premium key) → Google (key) →
//! macOS `say`, which on a keyless FREE machine skipped every neural voice and
//! landed on the system default — a woman's voice, nothing like the product's
//! (operator report 2026-07-12, free MacBook, read-back chord). The node side
//! has always had the free Steffan voice for the play button; this bridges the
//! Rust chain to it over loopback (which passes the API gate by design) so
//! keyless machines read back in the same voice as everyone else. Failure here
//! still falls through to `say` — the always-works floor.

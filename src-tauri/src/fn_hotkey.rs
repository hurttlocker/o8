//! Global Fn hotkey → system-wide push-to-talk dictation (macOS only).
//!
//! Lifted from aqua/Symon's `start_fn_key_monitor`. The live gesture map:
//!
//! - Hold Fn → push-to-talk dictation (paste at the caret on release).
//! - Double-tap Fn → long-form dictation (single Fn tap finishes, Esc cancels).
//! - Hold Right Option → Symon voice AGENT (tool-calling loop; release
//!   ≥120ms runs the command, a KeyDown mid-hold cancels so ⌥-chords stay safe).
//! - Optionally, hold bottom-left Control → the same Symon agent gesture. This
//!   substitutes for the firmware-only Fn key on many Windows-layout boards.
//! - Double-tap Right Option → long-form AGENT question (single Option tap
//!   finishes, Esc cancels).
//!
//! Implementation notes:
//!
//! - A raw `CGEventTap` at `CGEventTapLocation::HID` (Sequoia 15.7.x has a
//!   confirmed regression where SESSION-level taps silently stop delivering
//!   events; HID taps run earlier in the pipeline and are unaffected).
//! - Hold Fn → `paste::save_frontmost_app()` + `stt_engine::start()`.
//!   Release Fn → `stt_engine::stop()`; the finalize chain pastes (see the
//!   origin branch in `lib.rs::stt_engine::run_finalize`).
//! - A 40ms `CGEventSourceFlagsState` poll fallback for the dropped Fn-UP edge
//!   (the other half of the same Sequoia regression — the tap delivers the
//!   Fn-down FlagsChanged then goes silent, so the natural release never fires).
//! - `catch_unwind` around the entire callback body. The closure runs inside an
//!   extern "C" CGEvent tap callback; a panic cannot unwind across the C
//!   boundary — it ABORTS the whole o8 process (killing the Node sidecars). The
//!   catch converts any panic into a logged no-op so the app stays alive.
//!
//! The tap callback returns in microseconds: it only flips an `AtomicBool` edge
//! latch and spawns a worker thread. All STT / paste / activate work runs off
//! the tap thread — macOS auto-disables a tap whose callback runs too slowly.
//!
//! CRITICAL: this REUSES o8's existing `stt_engine` daemon. It NEVER spawns a
//! second recognizer — the Swift `speech_recognizer` sidecar is already owned by
//! `stt_engine::spawn` (called once from `setup()`).

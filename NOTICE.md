# Third-party notices

o8 includes third-party packages and adaptations whose authors retain their
copyrights. Those works remain subject to their own licenses; the o8 MIT
license does not replace or narrow those terms.

## Algorithms and techniques

### FLIP/PIC fluid simulation

- Author: Matthias Müller

- Source: <https://matthiasmueller.info/tenMinutePhysics/>

  `src/app/preview/effects/flip-fluid.ts`, rendered as ASCII glyphs by

The credit is for Müller's publicly published FLIP/PIC algorithm and
educational explanation. The o8 implementation was written independently; no
React Bits source code or implementation was used.

- Use in o8: animated title-bar icon behavior and the scroll-fade mask

The `skiper87` source additionally credits the original scroll-masking work to
jh3yy and the recreation to Gustav Ekerot. Those credits are preserved here.
These are adaptations; o8 does not claim authorship of the upstream patterns.

/**
 * Session rules store (#1329) — operator-authored rules scoped to ONE
 * orchestrator thread. Ephemeral by design: a rule belongs to a thread id
 * (e.g. `thoughts-1779296462456`) and never applies to another thread. A new
 * thread starts with a clean session tier; rules die with the thread.
 *
 * This is the missing rule TIER between a chat message (decays as context
 * churns) and a Cortex directive (durable, repo-scoped). Active session rules
 * are re-injected into EVERY orchestrator turn and inherited by dispatched
 * workers, so they survive compaction — that's the difference between a rule
 * and a message.
 *
 * Storage is a dedicated SQLite table (NOT a `scope:'session'` extension of the
 * markdown directive files) because these are ephemeral, thread-keyed,
 * high-churn relational rows with a lifecycle tied to a thread — the
 * missions-store shape, not the directive-file shape. Keeping them separate is
 * what lets directives stay read-only while session rules stay editable.

 * How a spawn must treat a read-only session's OS sandbox.

 * `enforced` is deliberately independent of `O8_WORKER_SANDBOX`: that gate is
 * an operator opt-in for hardening NORMAL packets, and it defaults off. A
 * read-only packet is a governance promise, so its sandbox is mandatory —
 * without it the argv tool deny leaves Bash, and Bash can write the worktree.
 * The spawn chokepoint ORs this with the opt-in gate and stays FAIL-CLOSED: if
 * the sandbox cannot be built the run is refused, never downgraded.
 *
 * This module deliberately does NOT resolve the write-deny paths itself. The
 * git metadata dirs a read-only run must be denied are exactly the ones
 * `prepareWorkerSandbox` already probes in order to GRANT git access, so that
 * single probe owns both sides — see its `enforceReadOnly` input. A second
 * probe here could disagree with the grant and deny a narrower set.

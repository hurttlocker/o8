 * rerun, and quota-fallback all funnel through `launchRuntimeSurface`, and only
 * one of them threads a launch context. Resolving here means a read-only packet
 * stays read-only on every relaunch, including `reset_packet` -> dispatch.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED. A packet launch whose durable state cannot be read — the lookup
 * throws, or the packet is not in durable state at all — is REFUSED, not
 * defaulted to write access. Falling back to the caller's payload was the
 * widening hole: a read-only packet whose control-plane read failed would have
 * launched with full write permissions, which is exactly the governance promise
 * this feature exists to keep.
 *
 * Two cases are deliberately NOT refusals, because neither is an unresolved
 * mode: a scratch launch (no packetId — there is no durable packet to consult),
 * and a packet that IS recorded but carries no launch context. `launchContext`
 * is optional metadata that most write packets never set, so refusing those
 * would brick normal dispatch while proving nothing about read-only.

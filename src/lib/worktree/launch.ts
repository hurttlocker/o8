/**
 * Worktree Launch Integration
 *
 * Wires WorktreeManager into the agent launch flow.
 * - All supported agents (Codex, Claude Code): creates a managed git worktree,
 *   runs the pre-launch rebase onto origin/<baseBranch>, sets cwd for agent
 *   launch.
 *
 * Historically claude-code got the `--worktree` CLI flag and Claude managed
 * its own worktree externally. That skipped the pre-launch rebase and let
 * stale-base packets revert upstream work (#608). We now force managed mode
 * for claude-code so it walks through the same rebase gate Codex does.
 *
 * Auto-toggle: worktree isolation defaults ON when repo has active agents,
 * OFF when it's the first/only agent.
 *
 * @see https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/65
 * @see https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/608

 * Cross-house model bleed guard, driven by the runtime registry.
 *
 * The composer passes whatever model it holds, and when that model belongs to
 * another house the CLI is handed an id it cannot launch. It has happened in
 * both directions: a claude id reaching `codex exec` hung the turn forever with
 * nothing streamed (live hit 2026-07-05), and `gpt-5.6-sol` --
 * `default_dispatch_model`, the Codex WORKER model -- reaching the Claude
 * harness failed a fresh solo turn immediately (#1807).
 *
 * Each of those was patched where it was found, one house at a time. With 18
 * dispatchable runtimes that does not converge: every new pairing is the same
 * bug wearing a different model id. The constraint belongs to the runtime, so
 * it lives on the runtime's registry row as `modelIdPattern`, and a runtime
 * that fronts several providers simply omits it.

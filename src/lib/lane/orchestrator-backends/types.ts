/**
 * Orchestrator backend contract.
 *
 * An "orchestrator backend" is a runtime that, given a user message + the o8
 * operator MCP config, drives one orchestrator turn and emits an
 * `OrchestratorEvent` stream. Codex and Claude are the first two backends;
 * openclaw is added next, Hermes after.
 *
 * The backend is NOT the worker runtime. Workers (Codex packets in isolated
 * worktrees) are dispatched by the orchestrator through the o8 operator MCP,
 * regardless of which backend orchestrates — that is the whole point of the
 * orchestrator-runtime ≠ worker-runtime rule (issue #1075).
 *
 * See `registry.ts` for the registry + the Codex/Claude delegate backends.

 * no subscription draw; it has no tools and never dispatches (v1).

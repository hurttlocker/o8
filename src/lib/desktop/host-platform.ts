/**
 * Host platform of the native shell, stamped by Rust before first paint (#1743).
 *
 * `src-tauri/src/lib.rs` sets `window.__O8_HOST_PLATFORM__` from
 * `std::env::consts::OS` in the main window's `initialization_script`, which
 * WKWebView / WebView2 / WebKitGTK run at document-start — so the value is
 * readable SYNCHRONOUSLY from the pre-paint theme stamp in `<head>`, before any
 * Tauri IPC exists. That is why this is a window global and not
 * `getDesktopInfo()` (async invoke, far too late for the boot cover).
 *
 * The desktop chrome is built around macOS vibrancy: translucent panels paint
 * over an NSVisualEffectMaterial backdrop and the window controls are DOM-drawn
 * traffic lights over an overlay titlebar. Windows and Linux have neither, so
 * both consumers ask the same question — "is this a non-macOS shell?":
 *
 *   - theme (`src/lib/theme/context.tsx` + `pre-paint-stamp.ts`) forces
 *     `surface = 'solid'`, because translucent chrome would composite against
 *     nothing.
 *   - the header strips (`components/desktop/shell/TrafficLights.tsx`) render
 *     no window controls, because the OS draws real ones on a decorated window.
 *
 * ABSENT is macOS-equivalent on purpose: a plain browser, and any installed
 * shell older than this change, keep the existing behavior untouched.

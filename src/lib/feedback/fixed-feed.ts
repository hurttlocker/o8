/**
 * The in-app receipt: "your report was fixed in this version."
 *
 * #fixed only reaches people who joined the Discord. This reaches everyone who
 * ever filed a report — which is the whole point of a receipt.
 *
 * How it costs nothing and leaks nothing:
 *   - We DOWNLOAD a public manifest (fixed.json) that release.mjs ships next to
 *     latest.json on the public o8-releases mirror. Same anonymous GitHub asset
 *     the updater already fetches: no server, no auth, no bill.
 *   - We UPLOAD nothing. The join happens locally, against this machine's own
 *     ledger (~/.o8/feedback/reports.jsonl). No report ids leave the box, no
 *     telemetry, no identity. The manifest carries no reporter handles either.
 *
 * So the receipt works even for an operator with crash reporting turned off.

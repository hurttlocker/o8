/**
 * Gate for the ws-server's worktree conflict scan.
 *
 * The scan used to run the full worktree probe every 5 seconds regardless of
 * whether anything had changed, then throw the result away when the hash
 * matched — which, on an idle app, is every single time. On the operator's Intel
 * box that was ~519ms of git subprocesses per tick (~10% of a core, forever) to
 * re-derive an answer nobody asked for.
 *
 * The probe is now event-driven: it runs when a watcher says something could
 * actually have changed. This module holds the two decisions that make that
 * safe, as pure functions, so they can be tested directly rather than being
 * buried inside a 6,000-line server module.
 *
 * The invariant that matters: **we may run the probe when nothing changed
 * (merely wasteful), but we must never SKIP it when something did (a missed
 * merge conflict).** Every branch below is written to fail toward scanning.

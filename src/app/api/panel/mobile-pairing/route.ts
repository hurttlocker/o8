/**
 * Mobile pairing payload — the data the desktop QR code encodes.
 *
 * The native o8 mobile app (hurttlocker/o8-mobile) can't inherit the backend
 * address the way the old PWA did — the phone loads nothing from the Mac. So
 * desktop emits a QR with everything the phone needs to reach this backend:
 *
 *   { host, apiPort, wsPort, token }
 *
 * `host` prefers the Mac's Tailscale IPv4 so the phone keeps working away from
 * local Wi-Fi, with LAN IPv4 as a fallback. `token` is the ws-token already
 * trusted by `src/middleware.ts` as a `Bearer` credential for non-loopback
 * callers — pairing only delivers it, the auth model is unchanged.
 *
 * Gated under `/api/panel/*` middleware: the desktop webview calls it from
 * loopback (passes automatically); a cross-origin caller would already need
 * the token to get here.

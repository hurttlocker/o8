# ChatGPT plan sign-in development acceptance

This is the source acceptance record for the desktop text-chat increment of
[#2951](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/2951). It is separate from the
[hosted plugin connection](./openai-plugin-submission.md). Source preparation
does not establish installed acceptance, OpenAI qualification, or publication.

## Behavior

Onboarding and Settings > Models & providers offer **Continue with ChatGPT** after the user
signs in to o8. The local broker uses the open-source loopback OIDC flow with
PKCE, state, nonce and an opaque installation identifier. It retains the issued
client registration across retries and restarts. Identity and plan-use scope
are checked separately. Email labels do not merge accounts.

The initial secure-store implementation supports macOS. Other platforms fail
closed. OpenAI tokens remain in the OS Keychain; the renderer receives connection
metadata and account-available model names. Refresh is serialized across
processes, and an uncertain rotation is held rather than replayed. Disconnect
clears local access before requesting issuer revocation and reports an
unconfirmed remote result.

In the workspace **Add pane** menu, choose **ChatGPT plan chat** to open a
dedicated tab. Its model selector lists only models available from the connected
plan. This normal entry supports text requests and inherits no repository,
worker runtime or lead defaults. Conversations remain while the tab is open,
including during ordinary navigation. Closing it or changing the connected
account clears its temporary conversation. Tab metadata restores after restart;
conversation text is not persisted by this pane.

The dedicated text route uses Responses with `stream: true` and `store: false`,
disables tools and accepts only user/assistant text. It includes a static text
chat instruction and the explicitly supplied conversation, without gathering
workspace rules, files, repository names or personalized account context. The
request retains the discovered account, grant generation and desktop session.
A changed selection is refused before provider access and clears the prior
conversation before another send. Sign-out, disconnect and close abort pending
work; old async replies cannot paint another account's view.

Plan turns stop on caps, auth errors, incomplete streams or unsupported
requests. Incomplete text stays visibly partial. They do not automatically
retry, move to API billing, generate follow-up inference or compact via another
model. Successful messages retain subscription-route metadata; token counts do
not establish allowance savings or an API price.

The separate underlying local-function route remains source-tested with a
registered repository and exact operator approvals. This text chat does not
expose that route or provide a ChatGPT API lead or Symon integration.

## Source evidence

- [Entry-point tests](../../src/lib/chatgpt-plan/plan-entry.test.ts) call the
  exported connection, inference and approval handlers against a signed stub
  OIDC provider, streamed Responses fixture and persisted state. They cover
  fresh profiles without CLIs, restart, scope denial, replay, account switches,
  refresh uncertainty, issuer revocation refusal, approved edits and interrupted
  continuations. A separate-process fixture proves serialized rotating refresh.
- [Mounted UI tests](../../src/components/desktop/settings/ChatGPTPlanConnection.test.ts)
  cover first-commit account privacy, stale action/reply refusal, retained
  registration retry, Disconnect visibility during provider failure, and saved
  model restoration without selecting another provider.
- [Workspace pane tests](../../src/components/desktop/workspace-terminal/ChatGPTPlanChat.test.ts)
  mount the normal launcher, text pane and shared streaming path. They cover
  bound requests, sign-out/account privacy, disconnect, incomplete completion,
  external selection changes and retention beyond the heavy-pane budget.
- [Desktop state route tests](../../src/app/api/panel/terminal-state/route.test.ts)
  persist and restore the explicit tab without adopting a repository or terminal.
  The entry-point fixture also verifies the exact upstream input and refuses
  stale selection, repository and tool context for text-only requests.
- [Streaming tests](../../src/components/desktop/llm-chat/streaming-plan.test.ts)
  cover split frames, explicit completion, malformed data, usage metadata and
  absence of extra automatic inference.
- [Opt-in native credential test](../../src/lib/chatgpt-plan/native-keychain.test.ts)
  verifies a large synthetic record through the real macOS Keychain, including
  replacement and a cold read. The test creates and removes only its own entries.

## Remaining acceptance

- OpenAI qualification for o8's intended open-source distribution before release.
- Actual consent and first inference in an installed desktop, natural refresh,
  remote revoke, account switching and interrupted-stream behavior.
- Equivalent OS credential stores on supported non-macOS platforms.
- Explicit integration with the orchestrator API lead and Symon text work.
- Hosted worker creation under a separate grant, tracked in
  [#3249](https://github.com/hurttlocker/o8/issues/3249), and an installed
  ChatGPT-to-worker round trip on a disposable repository.
- The attributable planning/execution allowance experiment in
  [the usage protocol](./chatgpt-plugin-usage.md).

See the [account and consent contract](./openai-account-consent.md) for the
identity, payer and recipient boundaries. Sign-in adds no subscription allowance
and grants no access to ChatGPT conversations or memories.

## Profile credential isolation

The macOS broker binds each Keychain index and chunk to the stable local host ID
and o8 account. Independently initialized profiles cannot read or replace each
other's credentials. Profiles copied with the same host ID retain the same
credential identity and share one OS-user rotation lock, even under different
profile paths. Owner-only records from earlier unpublished development are not
automatically adopted; the operator must authenticate again.

The actual Keychain synthetic fixture verifies independent read/replacement,
cold reopening, copied-host lock exclusion and cleanup. It grants no live OpenAI
access and does not establish installed OAuth or provider inference acceptance.

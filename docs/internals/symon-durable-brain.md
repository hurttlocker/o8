# Symon durable brain

Symon can answer text on the built-in Pi agent and the o8 managed model, with
every conversation kept in a durable store. An install with no agent CLI, and a
desktop whose bridge is not running, can still answer.

Source: `src/lib/symon/durable/`.

## Store

- One Pi Durable store per o8 data directory: `<data dir>/symon/durable.sqlite`
  (`@earendil-works/pi-durable`, SQLite through `node:sqlite`).
- Only the o8 server process opens it. Pi Durable has no cross-process locking,
  so no other process may open the same file.
- A session document, `symon.directory`, maps each thread key to its
  conversation, with the source (`messages`, `phone`, `voice`, `app`), title and
  timestamps.
- One conversation per thread. A managed-message thread uses its
  `conversationId` as the key, for example `imessage:direct:<handle>`.

## Turns

- `SymonBrain.send()` admits one input under the caller's request id and waits
  up to the caller's window. A repeated request id returns the same submission,
  so a retried delivery never starts a second model turn.
- Every input and model turn is committed before it is shown. After a restart,
  the next send or `resume()` continues an unfinished turn from its checkpoint.
- Retries are off (`retry.maxRetries: 0`). The managed transport makes one
  attempt, and a failed turn is reported.
- Compaction is on with a 24,000-token window, so a long thread is summarized
  before a request grows large. Background compaction is off.
- A failed turn shows only o8's allowance text, when the managed relay reports
  an exhausted allowance, or a fixed reply. Provider text never reaches the
  sender.

## Model access

`createSymonManagedProvider()` registers the managed model as a pi-ai provider
whose streams call `createManagedPiTransport()`. The route and its credential
headers are resolved by the host for each call and never enter the store.

## o8 commands

The brain has the three catalog tools the Pi orchestrator uses: `o8_commands`,
`o8_command_help` and `o8_run` (`src/lib/symon/durable/o8-tools.ts`). They are
backed by the `propose` tool profile, so the operator server, which dispatches
and merges, is not opened and cortex runs read-only. The brain can report what
is running, waiting for review or approval, and the state of projects, issues,
pull requests and CI. It cannot start, approve, merge or change anything, and
its prompt says so.

The servers open on the first command and close after 15 idle minutes; the next
command reopens them. A command a restart interrupts is reported to the model
as interrupted and is not run again.

## Brain selection

`<data dir>/symon/text-brain.json` holds the mode, read for each new turn and
set through `GET`/`POST /api/panel/symon/text-brain`:

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `auto` (default) | The native planner when its desktop bridge answers and a planner CLI is installed; otherwise the Pi brain. |
| `pi` | Always the Pi brain. |
| `planner` | Always the native planner. A missing CLI returns `503 no_cli` as before. |

## Managed messages

`POST /api/symon/managed-messages/inbound` routes a direct or full-access group
turn to the Pi brain by the mode above. Its session id is
`pi-brain:<conversationId>`. When the thread's earlier turns were answered by
the planner, the last twelve are passed to the Pi brain as data with the new
message. A Pi turn that a restart interrupted is finished on the next delivery
instead of being answered with a request to send it again. Limited-access
shared groups keep their tool-free path.

## Phone text sessions

`POST /api/mobile/symon/text-session` binds a new phone session to the Pi brain
(engine `pi`, the managed model, effort `default`) when the mode is `pi`, when
the phone asks for the managed model (`managed-free`), or on `auto` when the
desktop bridge or a planner CLI is missing and the phone named no model. An
explicit native model pin is never replaced. `POST /api/mobile/symon/text-turn`
answers a Pi session on the brain under the key `phone:<sessionId>`, with the
newest message (`text`) only, since the brain keeps the history; the turn id is
the request id, so a repeated poll reaches the same turn. A turn naming another
engine than its session's is refused with `409`. `DELETE` stops a running Pi
turn.

## Conversations API

Panel-authenticated routes over the same store, for the Symon tab:

| Route | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/panel/symon/conversations?limit=` | Threads from every source, newest first: key, source, title, timestamps. |
| `GET /api/panel/symon/conversations/transcript?key=&limit=` | One thread's user and assistant text, oldest first. `404` for an unknown key. |
| `POST /api/panel/symon/conversations/continue` | Body `{ key, requestId, text }`. Continues a known thread, or starts one under an `app:` key. A repeated `requestId` returns the same turn. `202` while the turn runs. |

| `POST /api/panel/symon/conversations/record` | Body `{ key, requestId, entries }` with a `voice:` key and up to 20 `{ role, text }` lines. Records voice transcript lines without asking the model. |

An answer to a thread continued in o8 stays in o8; it is not sent back to the
phone or the messaging thread.

## Recorded exchanges

Turns another surface answers are written into the brain's thread as
`symon.relay` entries, without a model call: managed-message turns the native
planner answered, native phone turns, and voice lines sent to the record route.
They appear in the transcript as user and assistant lines, and a later Pi turn
sees them as earlier conversation. Recording is best effort and never delays or
fails the reply. A thread the brain has never seen still receives the managed
store's last twelve turns as data on its first Pi turn.

The desktop voice session records itself: `RealtimeVoiceHost` passes realtime
events to `createSymonVoiceTranscriptRecorder()`
(`src/lib/symon/voice-transcript-recorder.ts`), which posts each finished line
to the record route. The operator's line is written when its input
transcription completes and Symon's when its audio transcript is done. Each
voice session is one `voice:` thread, and the event's item id is the request
id, so a repeated event records nothing new.

## Current limits

- The Pi brain only reads o8. It cannot act on the computer or change o8.
- Voice sessions the phone hosts are not recorded; only the desktop voice session is.
- Limited-access shared group turns are not recorded.

## Tests

- `tests/symon-durable-brain-real-path.test.ts`: answer, duplicate delivery,
  per-thread context, restart on the same store, bounded failure text, and the
  managed request body.
- `tests/symon-managed-messages-pi-brain-real-path.test.ts`: the inbound route
  on each mode, planner-to-Pi context, and a restart mid-turn.
- `tests/symon-phone-pi-brain-real-path.test.ts`: phone sessions bound by
  mode, by the managed model and on auto fallback; native pins unchanged; engine
  mismatch refused; repeated polls; Stop.
- `tests/symon-conversations-api-real-path.test.ts`: list, transcript,
  continue, a repeated request id, refusals, and bounded failure text.
- `tests/symon-brain-o8-commands-real-path.test.ts`: a command answered from
  its result, the offered tools and prompt, the read-only projection, an
  interrupted command after a restart, and idle close and reopen.
- `tests/symon-voice-record-real-path.test.ts`: a desktop voice session from
  the voice host through the record route into one voice thread, one thread
  per session, and skipped or failed lines.

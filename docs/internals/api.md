# o8 API reference

This is the canonical reference for o8's HTTP surface. All routes live under
`src/app/api/` as Next.js route handlers. The filesystem currently contains
**303 route files across 34 top-level families** (audited 2026-07-23 against
`main`).

## Auth model

o8's API is default-deny:

- **Operator:** stateful and sensitive routes require
  `Authorization: Bearer <ws-token>`, including requests originating on
  loopback. The desktop, CLI, and MCP proxy attach the token.
- **Paired device / worker:** device and worker tokens can reach only the
  method-and-path capabilities explicitly listed in `src/middleware.ts`.
- **Public or self-authenticating:** the small public-read, enrollment,
  webhook, cloud-worker, and service-account surfaces are individually
  allowlisted or authenticate inside their handlers.
- **Loopback-read exceptions:** a few iframe and boot resources accept
  socket-truth loopback because browser navigation cannot attach a bearer.

There is no gated-prefix allowlist. Every `/api/*` route fails closed unless
`src/middleware.ts` names its public, principal, or self-authenticating policy;
`tests/route-coverage.test.ts` keeps that policy exhaustive as route files move.

**Never expose a new route by omission.** Add the narrowest explicit
method-and-path policy and a middleware/route-coverage test in the same change.

## Conventions

- App Router routes use the Node.js runtime unless a route explicitly declares
  another runtime. Routes that must bypass caching export
  `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`; this is not a universal boilerplate requirement.
- Errors return structured JSON: `{ ok: false, error: '<message>' }` with appropriate HTTP status. Never throw — always return a response.
- Pagination is opt-in per-route via `?limit=<n>&offset=<n>` query params (not standardized across the surface).
- Realtime updates ship over WebSocket (`/ws`) on the dynamically selected port
  written to `~/.o8/ws-port` (dev default `47125`; packaged block
  `47105`–`47109`). See `src/ws-server.ts`.
Note: the realtime `lane-lifecycle` payload carries lane status in the `status` field, not `laneStatus`; client readers should coalesce via `laneStatusOf()` in `src/lib/orchestrator/status-events.ts`.

### `/api/leases` — Named resource coordination (gated)

Operator and worker credentials can use this route. Device and anonymous callers are denied.
The handler captures the submitted local owner PID's exact boot/start identity before recording
ownership. Worker mutations additionally prove that the submitted owner and waiter PIDs belong to
the process tree bound to that packet credential; worker labels and ledger actors come from the
authenticated principal, not the request body. Workers cannot mutate the governance-reserved
`repo-tree:`, `test-suite:`, or `apfs-mounts:` namespaces. Acquire creates a private claim that is
never returned by status/list; release and heartbeat require both the exact process identity and
that claim. An overdue lease remains held until release or confirmed process death; an unknown
identity fails closed.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/leases?resource=...` | Read one holder and its FIFO waiter queue. Omit `resource` to list active resources. |
| POST | `/api/leases` | Acquire, release, or heartbeat a named resource using an explicit action body. |

### `/api/mobile/*` — Mobile surface for the native o8-mobile app (partial)

Mobile clients present an enrolled device bearer. `src/middleware.ts` grants
that principal only the named method-and-path capabilities; operator-only
mobile routes still require the operator bearer. The VAPID public key is the
narrow read-only exception.

### `/api/tasks/*` — Task pool mutation surface (gated)

The global middleware requires an affirmative operator, paired-device, or
worker principal according to the explicit task capability. Mutation wrappers
also validate the request body and actor at the handler layer.

Every `[taskId]/<action>` route is a thin wrapper around `runTaskMutationRoute` calling the matching `lib/tasks` mutator.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/api/tasks?projectId=...&repoPath=...&includeDone=true&includeBrief=true` | List task pool (filtered). |
| POST | `/api/tasks` | Create a task pool entry. |
| GET | `/api/tasks/[taskId]?projectId=...&repoPath=...` | Read a single task with `o8/task.detail/v1` schema. |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/archive` | Archive a task. |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/block` | Block a task with a `reason` + optional `AgentReportReason` code. |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/claim` | Claim a task (sets actor / note). |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/dispatch` | Dispatch a task to a runtime (model, worker intent, requested provider). |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/prune` | Prune a task with a reason. |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/remove` | Remove a task with a reason. |
| POST | `/api/tasks/[taskId]/report` | Report progress / status / metadata for a task. |

### `/api/tts/*` — Text-to-speech (operator or paired-device capability)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/tts` | Server-side TTS via `edge-tts` Python (browser can't set DRM headers Microsoft now requires). |

### `/api/v2/*` — v2 API layer: auth, chat, files, BYOK, proxies (partial)

This is the consumer-facing API. Route handlers use the session JWT cookie
where applicable, while the global middleware still requires an allowed
principal for stateful routes. Only session inspection (read) and logout
(self-authenticating cookie revocation) are public middleware exceptions.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/v2/auth/logout` | Revoke session row + clear auth cookie. |
| GET | `/api/v2/auth/session` | Read current authenticated user profile. |

| GET | `/api/v2/chat-history?tabId=...` | Read persisted LLM chat messages per tab. |
| POST | `/api/v2/chat-history` | Append a message to a tab's history. |
| PATCH | `/api/v2/chat-history` | Update a tab's history. |

| POST | `/api/v2/files` | Write / edit a workspace file. |
| GET | `/api/v2/keys` | List configured BYOK providers (keys masked). |
| POST | `/api/v2/keys` | Set / update a provider key. |
| DELETE | `/api/v2/keys` | Remove a provider key. |
| POST | `/api/v2/proxy/cli` | Route chat through an installed CLI runtime (Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI). |
| POST | `/api/v2/proxy/llm` | BYOK provider proxy (Anthropic / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Gemini) with cost computation + cache multipliers. |

| GET | `/api/worktrees/diff?sessionKey=...&worktreePath=...&baseBranch=...` | Full unified diff for an agent's worktree vs base. |
| GET | `/api/worktrees/diff-summary?sessionKey=...&worktreePath=...&baseBranch=...` | `{ additions, deletions, fileCount }` for a worktree. |
| POST | `/api/worktrees/merge` | Create PR, merge to main, or discard a worktree. |

# Verify o8 release downloads

Every public Windows and Linux installer has a SHA-256 checksum and a signed
GitHub build-provenance attestation. Release AppImages also contain an embedded
GPG signature made by the o8 Linux release key.

## Verify build provenance

Download an installer, install the GitHub CLI, and run:

```bash
gh attestation verify ./o8_0.1.663_linux_amd64_preview.AppImage \
  --repo hurttlocker/o8
```

Use the same command for the Windows MSI or EXE and the Linux DEB or RPM. A
successful result ties the exact downloaded bytes to the public o8 repository,
workflow, and commit recorded by GitHub's Sigstore-backed attestation service.

## Verify checksums

Download `SHA256SUMS-windows-linux-preview.txt` beside the installers, then run:

```bash
sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS-windows-linux-preview.txt
```

## Verify the AppImage signature

The public key is in
[`docs/user/o8-linux-release-signing.asc`](./o8-linux-release-signing.asc). Its
fingerprint is:

```text
9C8E BBFE EE6C C183 D495 5D52 3787 DCFF EBA0 FC78
```

Import the public key and use the AppImage validation tool described in the
[Tauri Linux signing guide](https://v2.tauri.app/distribute/sign/linux/). The
validator should report this fingerprint and a successful signature check.

Windows installers additionally need an Authenticode publisher signature to
avoid the unsigned-publisher warning in Windows. Build-provenance attestation
proves origin and integrity, but it does not replace Authenticode trust.

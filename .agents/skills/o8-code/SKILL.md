# Code and architecture

- o8 is a Next.js 16 and React 19 app in a Tauri v2 shell. Desktop and mobile are separate surfaces.
  Orchestrator backends in `src/lib/lane/orchestrator-backends/` and worker adapters in
  `src/lib/runtimes/` are separate systems. Inspect the current registries before changing routing.

- Runtime code is the source of truth for ports, routes, commands, and registrations. Never hardcode
  API or WebSocket ports, user home paths, or stale inventory counts. Use the existing resolvers and
  registries.

- API middleware is default-deny for `/api/*`. Public routes require deliberate narrow allowlisting;
  externally reachable self-authenticating routes must verify their own credentials. Return structured
  route errors rather than throwing to the framework.

- TypeScript is strict. Use the existing two-space, single-quote, semicolon style and `@/` imports.
  The default file ceiling is 800 lines; existing waivers do not authorize new ones.

- Ad-hoc model calls use the existing proxy and routing layer. The sanctioned AI SDK import boundary
  is `src/lib/chat/gateway-client.ts`. Strict-mode MCP schemas keep a plain top-level object; validate
  conditional relationships in the handler.

- Architecture and extension contracts: [`docs/internals/system-architecture.md`](../../../docs/internals/system-architecture.md),
  [`docs/internals/runtime-adapter-contract.md`](../../../docs/internals/runtime-adapter-contract.md), and the
  implementation named above. Historical inventories in docs are orientation, not runtime truth.

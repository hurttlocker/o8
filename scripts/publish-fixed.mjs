/**
 * publish-fixed — announce fixed reports in the public #fixed channel.
 *
 * The doctrine: intake is private (a report carries a screenshot of somebody's
 * whole screen and stack traces with their repo paths in them — that can never
 * go on a public board). The PUBLIC artifact is the fix. Open problems rot;
 * fixed ones never do. So we publish only wins, credited to whoever found them.
 *
 * The loop:
 *   1. Operator files a report  → private ops channel + a short id (A7F3K2),
 *                                 recorded in ~/.o8/feedback/reports.jsonl
 *   2. You fix it, and the commit carries a trailer:
 *
 *        fix(diff): stop blanking the panel on large worktrees
 *
 *        Fixes-Report: A7F3K2
 *
 *   3. This script posts to #fixed:
 *
 *        Diff panel went blank on large worktrees
 *        Reported by @kleosr · fixed in v0.1.592
 *
 *   4. scripts/release.mjs ships the same set as fixed.json, so the REPORTER's
 *      own app can tell them too — see scripts/lib/fixed-reports.mjs.
 *
 * `npm run ship` runs this automatically (release.mjs, after the public mirror
 * lands). Run it by hand to backfill or to preview.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   npm run publish:fixed -- --dry-run       # print, post nothing
 *   npm run publish:fixed -- --range v0.1.590..HEAD
 *
 * Webhook: O8_FIXED_WEBHOOK_URL, else `fixedWebhookUrl` in o8.release.json (the
 * gitignored release config that already holds the Sentry DSN). Absent → refuses
 * to run, rather than silently dropping somebody's credit.
 *
 * Idempotent: published ids are recorded in ~/.o8/feedback/published.json, so a
 * re-run on an overlapping range will not double-post.

  packet diff [id]     the packet's code diff vs base (committed + uncommitted)
  packet commit -m ".." stage + commit the current worktree with an explicit pathspec
  packet heartbeat [id] update a packet lane heartbeat
  packet review [id]   approve + merge a reviewed packet
  packet park [id]     remove a verified review-ready workspace while preserving immutable review
  packet restore [id]  restore a parked workspace to its exact reviewed state
  packet close [id]    close without merging (--reason adopted_elsewhere|superseded|spec_changed|wontfix)
  packet reset [id]    wipe a stuck packet's worktree + lane (then mission dispatch)
  packet stop [id]     interrupt the worker and hold the packet (resume with packet reset/rerun)
  packet cancel [id]   alias for packet stop; interrupt and hold the packet

  packet capture [id]  screenshot the agent's app as visual proof (--url --label --before/--after --clip/--full-page --wait-for --hover/--click)
